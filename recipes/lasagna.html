<h2> Description </h2>
<p> In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the best lasagna recipe. 
    Her ideal here has an intensely flavored sauce, cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were 
    bechamel, meat that’s just chunky enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.</p>

<p> To reheat frozen lasagna, defrost, then sprinkle with mozzarella and bake uncovered at 400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown and bubbling on the surface. Refrigerated lasagna also can be reheated in a 400-degree oven until heated through. Chilled small individual servings can be microwaved.</p>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium red onions, finely diced </li>
        <li>2 large cloves minced garli</li>

    </ul>

<h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the sauce, heat ½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle over low heat. Add the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly reduced, about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato paste and 2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.</li> 
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust the meatballs lightly with flour, shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides (do not cook through) and transfer to the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
